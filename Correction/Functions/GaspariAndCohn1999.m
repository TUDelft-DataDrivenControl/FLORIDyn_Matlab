% "To achieve covariance localization by Schur product a function, œÅ, 
% is normally defined to be a correlation function with local support. 
% Local support is a term meaning that the function is only non zero in a 
% small (local) region and is zero elsewhere. The correlation function is 
% commonly taken to be the compactly supported 5th order piecewise rational
% function as defined in Gaspari and Cohn (1999)"
